      <p>In a welcome piece of good news for the world’s threatened wildlife, the giant panda has just been downgraded from <strong>Endangered</strong> to <strong>Vulnerable</strong>
      on the global list of species at risk of extinction,<br>
      demonstrating how an integrated approach can help save our planet’s vanishing biodiversity.</p>
      <p>The International Union for Conservation of Nature
      <a href="https://www.iucn.org/"><strong>(IUCN)</strong></a>
      announced the positive change to the giant panda’s official
      status in the Red List of Threatened Species, pointing to the 17% rise in <br> the population in the decade up to 2014, when a nationwide census found 1,864 giant pandas in the wild in China.</p>
      <p>Ever since, WorldWildLife <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org"><strong>(WWF)</strong></a> has been working with the government on initiatives to save giant pandas and their habitat,
      including helping to establish an integrated network of giant panda <br> reserves and wildlife corridors to connect isolated panda populations as well as working with local communities to develop
      sustainable livelihoods and minimise their impact on the forests. <br> These efforts have seen the number of panda reserves jump to 67, which now protect nearly two-thirds of all wild pandas.
      They have also helped to safeguard large swathes of mountainous bamboo forests, <br> which shelter countless other species and provide natural services to vast numbers of people, including
      tens of millions who live alongside rivers downstream of panda habitat.</p><br><br>
